# Human-Activity-Detection

#### About The Project
Human activity detection or recognition is a process of interpreting human motion through computer vision. Human motion can be categorized into various activies which are recorded through electromagnetic and angular velocity sensors. The data collected can be translated into actions or behaviours performed by humans.
The objective of this project is to analyze human activities and develop machine learning models to classify human motion into a range of six activities. 

Dataset used for the project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones)
